# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## ðŸ”¹ What are Data Structures?
A **Data Structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.  
Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, etc.

### Types of Data Structures
1. **Linear Data Structures** â€“ Data is arranged sequentially.  
   - Examples: Arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue  
2. **Non-Linear Data Structures** â€“ Data is arranged hierarchically or graph-like.  
   - Examples: Trees, Graphs

## ðŸ”¹ What are Algorithms?
An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a task.  
It is language-independent and focuses on logic and problem-solving.

### Characteristics of Algorithms
- **Input**: Takes zero or more inputs  
- **Output**: Produces at least one output  
- **Finiteness**: Must terminate after a finite number of steps  
- **Definiteness**: Each step should be clear and unambiguous  
- **Effectiveness**: Should be simple enough to execute by hand

## ðŸ”¹ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Amount of time an algorithm takes to run as input size grows.  
  - Common notations: `O(1)`, `O(log n)`, `O(n)`, `O(n log n)`, `O(n^2)`  
- **Space Complexity**: Amount of memory required by an algorithm to run.
